    <p>Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who wants to become the leader of his village, the Hokage. The story is told in two parts, the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years and the second in his teens. Naruto is a problem child at the ninja academy and is treated with disdain by the adults in the village due to a secret surrounding his birth. He is loud, hyperactive, and constantly searches for approval and recognition. Naruto knows he must train harder than ever to face the mysterious Akatsuki organization and leaves his village for intense exercises. </p>
